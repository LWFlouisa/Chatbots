## Introducing The Writing
This will be the references for the Hafestran writing system. This will be updated once these are scanned.

### Mythology
The real world and dream world intermingle, between one druid who controls the daytime, and one that controls the night time. The midnight druid represent yang, and the daytime druid represents yin. The yang druid is believed to be the one that brings about disease and suffering. Those who died from things caused by the Yang druid, come back as Yurei that can only be cleansed by playing music boxes. Abandoned military facilities are thought to be ancient castles, haunted by societies of Yurei, and that at the end of the world a great battle between evil ghosts and the druids of the daylight will restore balance. Victory is won not through violence, but playing music boxes left over from the childhood of Yurei.

There is also Lais of Marie de France that told of the Ankou, Nain, and Youdics. Fairies are thought to be descendants of Ankou or Nain that breed with human brides, usually women carted away by death. Such children often are viewed both as cursed, and as protectors from evil spirits. Such beliefs persist in the Neo-Modern era ( the point in which technology returns from technological collapse. )
